# Sonic RSDK + Oxygen Engine (Help Needed)

Aims to mix different Sonic the Hedgehog games into a single big game. Acts as a legal but cheaper version of Sonic Origins for fans that dont want to get scammed.

![Sonic 1 in Sonic 2](docs/preview.png)

## How it's gonna work.
Instead of mixing 3 AIR'S Engine (called Oxygen) with the RSDK/Retro engine, or compiling rsdk and 3 air as seperate EXEs to be laucnhed in one window which is what this project gets confused as, the project will have 3 (main) working parts:

Sonic 3 AIR/Oxygen.

Sonic Hybrid RSDK plus RSDKV4/RSDKV3 (and maybe RSDKV5U).

And a custom script runner/executor.

When sonic 2 ends the Hybrid RSDK entity will send a message to the custom script executing entity which in turn stops running the RSDK stuff & starts running the main script of 3 air

## Completion Status:
Hybrid-RSDK Debugging/Additons ?% (Hybrid-RSDK is still broken)


Sonic 3 AIR (Oxygen) Integration 50% (All the source code is in the repo, but we havent done the neccessary changes yet)


Custom Client 0% (debugging Hybrid RSDK is the priority)

## WARNING: DOES NOT WORK YET!
Start from here:

This guide is useful if you never downloaded the project or if you want to start from scratch.

1. [Download](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sonic-hybrid-rsdk/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the latest release

1. Unpack the zip file

1. Paste in the directory `rsdk-source-data` the following files:

    * `Data.rsdk` from Sonic CD as `soniccd.rsdk`
    * `Data.rsdk` from Sonic 1 as `sonic1.rsdk`
    * `Data.rsdk` from Sonic 2 as `sonic2.rsdk`
    * `Rom.bin`   from Sonic 3&K as `sonic3.bin` (I doubt this will be addable as Sonic 3 is a ROM unlike the rest which is a RSDK)
1. Install [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

1. Open a terminal and run the command `dotnet run --project SonicHybridRsdk.Build`

1. Put the [RSDKv4](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation/releases/tag/1.3.2) engine in the `sonic-hybrid` folder (still havent decided)

1. Compile/run the executable and have fun!

## Resources

Xeeynamo has written [some notes](rsdkv3-to-rsdkv4.md) on how to convert RSDKv3 scripts to RSDKv4 scripts without modifying the RSDKv4 engine.

Everything contained in `rsdk/Scripts` is a modified version of [Rubberduckycooly's Sonic 1/2 script decompilation](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-Sonic-2-2013-Script-Decompilation). This project would not exist without it.

The function `SonicHybridRsdk.Unpack12/DecryptData` was written by Giuseppe Gatta (nextvolume) from its [Retrun](http://unhaut.epizy.com/retrun/).
